- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Basic functionality tested

### CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow exists: `.github/workflows/docker-hub-ec2.yml`
- [ ] Workflow syntax validated
- [ ] Test push to main branch
- [ ] GitHub Actions running successfully
- [ ] All workflow steps passing:
  - [ ] Backend tests
  - [ ] Frontend tests
  - [ ] Docker build
  - [ ] Docker push
  - [ ] EC2 deployment
  - [ ] Health checks
- [ ] Deployment notification received (if configured)

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### Service Health
- [ ] All containers running
- [ ] No container restarts
- [ ] Logs show no errors
- [ ] Frontend loads correctly
- [ ] Backend API responds
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] Redis connections working
- [ ] Email sending functional (test email)

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Page load times acceptable
- [ ] API response times good
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] CPU usage acceptable
- [ ] Disk space sufficient

### Security Check
- [ ] Secrets not exposed in logs
- [ ] Environment variables correct
- [ ] Database not publicly accessible (unless intended)
- [ ] API rate limiting configured
- [ ] CORS configured correctly
- [ ] Session management working

## üîÑ Ongoing Maintenance

### Daily
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions for any failures
- [ ] Check error logs on EC2
- [ ] Monitor disk space
- [ ] Verify services are running

### Weekly
- [ ] Review Docker Hub for image storage
- [ ] Check EC2 metrics (CPU, Memory, Network)
- [ ] Review application logs for errors
- [ ] Test backup restoration (if configured)

### Monthly
- [ ] Update system packages on EC2
- [ ] Review and update dependencies
- [ ] Audit security group rules
- [ ] Review and clean old Docker images
- [ ] Check SSL certificate expiration (if configured)

## üêõ Troubleshooting Reference

### If deployment fails:

#### GitHub Actions Failed
- [ ] Check Actions tab for error logs
- [ ] Verify all secrets are set correctly
- [ ] Ensure EC2 is accessible
- [ ] Check EC2 security group allows SSH
- [ ] Verify Docker Hub credentials

#### Services Won't Start
- [ ] Check `docker-compose logs`
- [ ] Verify `.env.prod` exists and is correct
- [ ] Check Docker Hub for image availability
- [ ] Ensure sufficient disk space
- [ ] Check memory availability

#### Database Issues
- [ ] Verify database container is running
- [ ] Check database credentials in `.env.prod`
- [ ] Ensure DATABASE_URL is correct
- [ ] Check migrations applied
- [ ] Review database logs

#### Connection Issues
- [ ] Verify EC2 security group rules
- [ ] Check if services are bound to correct ports
- [ ] Ensure no firewall blocking ports
- [ ] Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is correct
- [ ] Check nginx/reverse proxy if configured
